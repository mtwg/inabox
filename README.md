## Evaluation Criteria
Some criteria with which we can evaulate projects we may want to include in our stack

### Technical Considerations for each service:
- Can it be used in an isolated, per city instance capability?
- What are the performance needs during peak loads and in an ongoing basis?
- Does the service need to be always on to be useful

### User Considerations for Each Service:
- Who will need to use this service? And when?
- Are there multiple applications for this service across different types of efforts and user groups?

### Questions to Consider:
- Why is email necessary? What is it necessary for? Do we need to limit its usage? How can this be accomplished? Whats our easiest route to ensuring ease of use for PGP?
- Is a chat service necessary when we have signal & signal desktop? Why?
- Is Jitsi accessible to all of our users without an iPhone app?
- Should we use owncloud or its alternative? If so, what do we use it for that we wouldn't  use Martus for?
- What are some ways to unify account management? When are things like SSO, shared auth, single source password management a good idea or necessary? What threats do they present?
